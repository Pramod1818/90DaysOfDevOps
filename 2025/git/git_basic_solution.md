### (Advanced) Optional Extra Challenge
### ðŸ“Œ Challenge Overview
create another branch (e.g., `experimental`) from your main branch, make a conflicting change to `info.txt`, then switch back to `feature-update` and merge `experimental` to simulate a merge conflict. Resolve the conflict manually, then commit the resolution.

---
1. **Restore and Sync the `feature-update` Branch**
    ```sh
    # Fetch latest changes from remote
    git fetch origin

    # Checkout the feature-update branch
    git checkout -b feature-update origin/feature-update

    # Pull the latest updates from remote
    git pull origin feature-update

    # Verify sync status
    git branch -vv
    ```

2. **Create and Switch to the `experimental` Branch**
    ```sh
    # Create a new branch from feature-update
    git checkout -b experimental
    ```

3. **Modify `info.txt` in `experimental` (Create a Conflict)**
    Edit the `week-4-challenge/info.txt` file with the following changes:
    ```txt
    My Name: Pramod Kumar
    Introduction: I am learning DevOps and working on Git branching strategies.
    ```
    Then, commit and push the changes:
    ```sh
    # Stage and commit the changes
    git add week-4-challenge/info.txt
    git commit -m "Modified intro in experimental branch -2"

    # Push to remote repository
    git push origin experimental
    ```

4. **Merge `experimental` into `feature-update` to Create a Conflict**
    ```sh
    # Switch back to feature-update branch
    git checkout feature-update

    # Attempt to merge experimental
    git merge experimental
    ```
    At this point, Git will detect a merge conflict and ask you to resolve it manually.

5. **Resolve the Merge Conflict**
    Open `week-4-challenge/info.txt`, where Git will mark the conflict like this:
    ```txt
    <<<<<<< feature-update
    My Name: Pramod Kumar
    Introduction: I am focusing on advanced Git workflows.
    =======
    My Name: Pramod Kumar
    Introduction: I am learning DevOps and working on Git branching strategies.
    >>>>>>> experimental
    ```
    Manually edit the file to keep the correct content and remove the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).

    For example:
    ```txt
    My Name: Pramod Kumar
    Introduction: I am learning DevOps and focusing on advanced Git workflows.
    ```
    Save the file and proceed with the following commands:
    ```sh
    # Stage and commit the resolved file
    git add week-4-challenge/info.txt
    git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict between feature-update and experimental"

    # Push the resolved merge
    git push origin feature-update
    ```

6. **Delete Unneeded Branches After Merging**
    Once the pull request (PR) is merged, delete the branches to keep the repository clean:
    ```sh
    # Delete local branches
    git branch -d experimental
    git branch -d feature-update

    # Delete remote branches
    git push origin --delete experimental feature-update
    ```

### Task 6: Understanding Branching Strategies

#### Why Branching Strategies Matter:
   - **Isolating Features and Bug Fixes**: Develop new features without affecting `main`.
   - **Parallel Development**: Multiple developers can work independently.
   - **Reducing Merge Conflicts**: Smaller, frequent merges minimize conflicts.
   - **Enabling Code Reviews**: PRs allow peer review before merging.

   Common strategies:
   - **Git Flow**: `feature`, `develop`, `release`, and `hotfix` branches.
   - **GitHub Flow**: Always deployable `main`, with feature branches.
   - **Trunk-Based Development**: Short-lived branches merged frequently.

---

### Bonus Task: SSH Authentication

1. **Generate an SSH Key**
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen
   ```
   - Copy the public key from `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`.
   - Add it to GitHub under **SSH and GPG keys**.

2. **Switch Remote URL to SSH**
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<your-username>/90DaysOfDevOps.git
   ```

3. **Push Using SSH**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-update
   ```

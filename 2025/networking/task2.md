- **ELK Stack (Logstash) (5044)**: Used for logging and analytics. DevOps teams use Logstash to collect logs, transform data, and forward logs to Elasticsearch.
- **ELK Stack (Kibana) (5601)**: Used for visualization and logging. DevOps teams use Kibana to create dashboards, visualize logs, and monitor performance.

## 5. Security and Authentication
- **SSH (22)**: Used for secure remote access and file transfer. DevOps teams use SSH to access remote servers, manage infrastructure, and transfer files securely.
- **LDAP (389)**: Used for authentication and directory services. DevOps teams use LDAP to manage user identities, authenticate users, and authorize access to resources.
- **Kerberos (88)**: Used for authentication and authorization. DevOps teams use Kerberos to manage user identities, authenticate users, and authorize access to resources.
- **RADIUS (1812)**: Used for authentication and authorization. DevOps teams use RADIUS to manage user identities, authenticate users, and authorize access to resources.

## 6. Networking and Infrastructure
- **DNS (53)**: Used for domain name resolution and service discovery. DevOps teams use DNS to manage domain names, resolve hostnames, and discover services.
- **DHCP (67-68)**: Used for dynamic IP address allocation and network configuration. DevOps teams use DHCP to manage IP addresses, configure networks, and automate infrastructure provisioning.
- **SNMP (161-162)**: Used for network monitoring and management. DevOps teams use SNMP to collect metrics, monitor performance, and manage network devices.
- **NTP (123)**: Used for time synchronization and clock management. DevOps teams use NTP to synchronize clocks, manage time zones, and ensure consistent timekeeping.

## 7. Containerization and Orchestration
- **Docker (2375-2376)**: Used for containerization and application packaging. DevOps teams use Docker to create, deploy, and manage containerized applications.
- **Kubernetes (6443)**: Used for container orchestration and cluster management. DevOps teams use Kubernetes to automate deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **etcd (2379-2380)**: Used for distributed key-value storage and service discovery. DevOps teams use etcd to manage configuration data, discover services, and ensure consistent state across distributed systems.

## 8. CI/CD and Automation
- **Jenkins (8080)**: Used for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) automation. DevOps teams use Jenkins to automate build, test, and deployment processes.
- **GitLab CI/CD (443)**: Used for CI/CD automation and pipeline management. DevOps teams use GitLab CI/CD to automate build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Travis CI (443)**: Used for CI/CD automation and pipeline management. DevOps teams use Travis CI to automate build, test, and deployment processes.
